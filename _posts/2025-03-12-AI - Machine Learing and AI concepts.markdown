I recently completed the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/AamerSadiq-9608/90234AA9C5746E38?sharingId=4D3B72AC4C8C2E1D" target="_blank">Azure AI Fundamentals</a> certification,
giving me a solid foundation in understanding AI concepts and tools, which I am excited to put into practice.
In this blog, I want to share the knowledge I've gained, starting with the fundamental concepts of machine learning.
Let's get started.

From exploring different types of machine learning, like supervised and unsupervised learning,
to understanding models such as neural networks and clustering algorithms, I'll break down these topics and provide insights to help others on their learning paths
