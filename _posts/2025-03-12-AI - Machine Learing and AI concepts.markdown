I recently completed the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/AamerSadiq-9608/90234AA9C5746E38?sharingId=4D3B72AC4C8C2E1D" target="_blank">Azure AI Fundamentals</a> certification,
giving me a solid foundation in understanding AI concepts and tools, which I am excited to put into practice.
In this blog, I want to share the knowledge I've gained, starting with the fundamental concepts of machine learning.
Let's get started.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h3>AI Concepts</h3>

<h3>Types of Machine Learnings</h3>

Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three types, each serving unique purposes and leveraging distinct approaches.

<h4>Supervised Learning</h4>
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the output is already known. The algorithm learns by comparing its predictions to the actual outcomes and adjusts accordingly. Supervised learning can be separated into two types:

<h5>Regression</h5>
Regression is  used for predicting continuous numerical values based on input features. It analyzes the relationships between variables and estimates outcomes. The goal is to model the underlying patterns in the data to make accurate predictions. Examples
<ul>
    <li>Real-time data that measures the performance and health of your resources.</li>
