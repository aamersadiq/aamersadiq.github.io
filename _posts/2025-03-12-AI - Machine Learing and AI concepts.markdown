I recently completed the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/AamerSadiq-9608/90234AA9C5746E38?sharingId=4D3B72AC4C8C2E1D" target="_blank">Azure AI Fundamentals</a> certification,
giving me a solid foundation in understanding AI concepts and tools, which I am excited to put into practice.
In this blog, I want to share the knowledge I've gained, starting with the fundamental concepts of machine learning.
Let's get started.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h3>AI Concepts</h3>

<h3>Types of Machine Learnings </h3>

Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three types, each serving unique purposes and leveraging distinct approaches.

<h4>Supervised Learning:</h4>
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the output is already known. The algorithm learns by comparing its predictions to the actual outcomes and adjusts accordingly. Supervised learning can be separated into two types:

<h5>Regression:</h5>
Predicting continuous numerical values. Examples:
<ul>
    <li>Weather forecasting: predicting temperature or rainfall.</li>
    <li>Stock price prediction: estimating future prices based on market trends.</li>
    <li>Sales forecasting: predicting monthly revenue for a retail store.</li>
    <li>Healthcare: predicting patient recovery time based on treatment plans.</li>
    <li>Real estate: estimating housing prices based on property features.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Classification:</h5>
Categorizing data into discrete groups. It can be subdivided into binary and multi classification.  Examples:
<ul>
    <li>Email filtering: categorizing emails as spam or not spam.</li>
    <li>Fraud detection: identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.</li>
    <li>Medical diagnosis: predicting the presence of a disease based on test results.</li>
    <li>Image recognition: classifying objects in photographs.</li>
    <li>Customer feedback analysis: sorting reviews as positive or negative.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unsupervised Learning:</h4>
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the output is already known. The algorithm learns by comparing its predictions to the actual outcomes and adjusts accordingly. Supervised learning can be separated into two types:

<h5>Clustering:</h5>
Groups data points into clusters based on similarity. Examples:
<ul>
    <li>Customer segmentation: grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.</li>
    <li>Social network analysis: identifying communities within a network.</li>
    <li>Wildlife monitoring: grouping animal species based on migration patterns.</li>
    <li>Document organization: categorizing documents into similar topics.</li>
    <li>Market research: identifying trends among survey responses.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Dimensionality Reduction:</h5>
Simplifies datasets by removing redundant features.  Examples:
<ul>
    <li>Image compression: reducing the number of pixels while retaining essential information.</li>
    <li>Data visualization: projecting high-dimensional data into 2D/3D for better understanding.</li>
    <li>Genomics: reducing the dimensionality of genetic data for disease analysis.</li>
    <li>Speech processing: removing noise from audio signals while preserving clarity.</li>
    <li>Feature selection: identifying important variables in large datasets for machine learning.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reinforcement Learning:</h4>
Decision making to maximize rewards. Examples:
<ul>
    <li>Self-driving cars: learning optimal driving strategies.</li>
    <li>Game AI: training AI agents to play strategy games like chess or Go.</li>
    <li>Robotics: programming robots to navigate environments or perform tasks.</li>
    <li>Dynamic pricing: adjusting prices based on market demand.</li>
    <li>Energy optimization: controlling smart grids to reduce electricity consumption.</li>
</ul>
