This post is to keep my git knowledge at one placde. It consists of the commands I use frequently and will evolve as I discover more about git.


### Working Areas

### Basics

Create a new repository and push to origin:

``` git
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

### History, Status Etc
