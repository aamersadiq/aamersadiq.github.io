Many years ago, I had the pleasure of reading "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, and it made a significant impact on me. Recently, I came across a blog post <a href="https://arnold.gamboa.ph/2024/02/13/embracing-atomic-habits-for-career-growth-in-the-tech-industry/" target="_blank">'Embracing Atomic Habits for Career Growth in the Tech Industry'</a>  by Arnold Gamboa that summarizes the book's four core principles. I have applied these principles in my life for years, and recently, I used the book's teachings as the foundation for a presentation. I'm sharing this below in the hope of inspiring you as well.
