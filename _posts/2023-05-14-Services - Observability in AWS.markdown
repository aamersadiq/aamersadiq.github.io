Within the AWS environment, observability is supported through various integrated services provided by AWS. Here are some of the most popular observability services available within AWS that have proven invaluable in my experience. Let's dive in and explore!

<h4>Amazon CloudWatch Logs</h4>
CloudWatch Logs enables you to centralize the logs from all of your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use, in a single, highly scalable service. You can then easily view them, search them for specific error codes or patterns, filter them based on specific fields, or archive 
them securely for future analysis. CloudWatch Logs enables you to see all of your logs, regardless of their source, as a single and consistent flow of events ordered by time, and you can query them and sort them based on other dime

<h4>Amazon CloudWatch Metrics</h4>
Metrics are data about the performance of your systems. By default, many services provide free metrics for resources (such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, and Amazon RDS DB instances). You can also enable detailed monitoring for some resources, such as your Amazon EC2 instances, or publish your own application metrics. Amazon CloudWatch can load all the metrics in your account (both AWS resource metrics and application metrics that you provide) for search, graphing, and alarms.

Metric data is kept for 15 months, enabling you to view both up-to-the-minute data and historical data.

<h4>Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards</h4>
Amazon CloudWatch dashboards are customizable home pages in the CloudWatch console that you can use to monitor your resources in a single view, even those resources that are spread across different Regions. You can use CloudWatch dashboards to create customized views of the metrics and alarms for your AWS resources.

<h4>Amazon CloudWatch Alarms</h4>
Using CloudWatch alarms, you watch a single metric over a time period that you specify. If the metric exceeds a given threshold, a notification is sent to an Amazon Simple Notification Service topic or AWS Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions when a metric is in a particular state. Rather the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods.

<h4>AWS CloudTrail</h4>
AWS CloudTrail is a web service that enables you to monitor the calls made to the CloudWatch Logs API for your account, including calls made 
by the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and other services. When CloudTrail logging is turned on, 
CloudTrail captures API calls in your account and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. Each log file can contain one or 
more records, depending on how many actions must be performed to satisfy a request.

<h4>AWS X-Ray</h4>
AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your applicationâ€™s underlying components. You can use X-Ray to analyze both applications in development and in production, from simple three-tier applications to complex microservices applications consisting of thousands of services.

<h4>AWS Config</h4>
AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications to enable security and governance. With AWS Config you can discover existing AWS resources, export a complete inventory of your AWS resources with all configuration details, and determine how a resource was configured at any point in time. These capabilities enable compliance auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.
