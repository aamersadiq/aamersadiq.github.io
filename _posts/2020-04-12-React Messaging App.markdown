<p>
I have utilized this template as a starting point for several projects. It consists solely of a front-end interface, utilizing a mock API as the back-end. The template allows for the basic CRUD operations and provides a user-friendly interface for editing and displaying data. It can be adapted to fit any application that requires data management.
