<p>
I have been using AI agents — <strong>Cline/Roo</strong>, <strong>Claude Code</strong>, and <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> — and I want to share what that experience has been like for me.
</p>

<p>
With their help, I’ve been able to migrate a service domain’s data access layer from <strong>Entity Framework</strong> to <strong>Dapper</strong>, build an operational tool in <strong>Next.js</strong> that queries multiple databases and provides consolidated dashboards with search and drill‑down functionality, and experiment with a personal project using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>SageMaker</strong>, and <strong>Postgres</strong> to process and transform large datasets.
</p>

<p>
Each project had its own challenges, but what tied them together was how AI agents fundamentally changed the way I approached development. They didn’t just save me time — they made me more ambitious, more experimental, and more confident in tackling things I might have avoided in the past.
