I have been using AI agents <strong>Cline/Roo</strong>, <strong>Claude Code</strong>, and <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong>, and want to share what that experience has been like for me.
With their help, I’ve been able to migrate a service domain data access layer from <strong>Entity Framework</strong> to <strong>Dapper</strong>, build an operational tool in <strong>Next.js</strong> that queries multiple databases and provides consolidated dashboards with search and drill down functionality, and experiment with a personal project using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>SageMaker</strong>, and <strong>Postgres</strong> to process and transform large datasets.
Each project had its own challenges, but what tied them together was how AI agents fundamentally changed the way I approached development. They didn’t just save me time, they also made me more ambitious, more experimental, and more confident in tackling things I might have avoided in the past.

<h4>The Future of AI in Software Development</h4>

AI agents are reshaping how we build software, and I see several key shifts ahead:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Smaller teams: </strong>With AI amplifying individual productivity, small teams can achieve what once required large departments.</li>
    <li><strong>From agents to fleets: </strong>The evolution will be from single AI assistants to coordinated groups of agents working together.</li>
    <li><strong>Shift from coding to orchestration: </strong>Developers will spend less time writing every line of code and more time guiding, reviewing, and orchestrating AI agents.</li>
    <li><strong>Rise of prompt driven architecture: </strong>Requirements, prompts, and context management will become first class citizens, much like APIs and design patterns are today.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous learning systems: </strong>AI agents will learn from the codebase itself, spotting patterns, suggesting refactors, and predicting bugs before they happen.</li>
    <li><strong>Blurring of roles: </strong>Boundaries between frontend, backend, DevOps, and data engineering will soften as AI enables individuals to span multiple domains.</li>
    <li><strong>Faster prototyping, faster failure: </strong>AI can spin up prototypes in hours, encouraging more experimentation and accelerating innovation cycles.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethics and governance: </strong>Trust, transparency, and governance will be critical to ensure AI generated code is secure, maintainable, and aligned with business goals.</li>
</ul>

With AI agents, I can now build complete applications in days that would have taken months in the traditional workflow.
I could never, ever go back to the old way of developing software.
