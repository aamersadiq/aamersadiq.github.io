In this post, I will outline an eâ€‘commerce platform using GraphQL Federation and Next.js. The goal was not just to spin up another demo shop, it was to explore how these technologies can work together to create a platform that is scalable, maintainable, and ready for real world complexity. Along the way, I will share the architectural decisions, trade offs, and lessons learned that you can apply to your own projects.

<h4>Introduction</h4>

E commerce platforms require robust, scalable architectures that can handle complex business logic while providing excellent user experiences. This project implements a comprehensive solution using GraphQL Federation for the backend and Next.js for the frontend, following domain driven design principles and a clear separation of concerns.

The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, with separate subgraphs for different domains of the application. This approach allows teams to work independently on different parts of the system while maintaining a cohesive API for the frontend.

<h4>Technologies Used</h4>
<h5>Frontend Technologies</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>React</strong>: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with a component based architecture</li>
  <li><strong>Next.js</strong>: A React framework that provides server side rendering, static site generation, and the App Router</li>
  <li><strong>App Router</strong>: Next.js routing system that enables more flexible and powerful routing patterns</li>
  <li><strong>React Hooks</strong>: Functions that let you use state and other React features without writing classes</li>
  <li><strong>State Management</strong>: Custom hooks for local state management with local storage synchronization</li>
  <li><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>: A utility first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces</li>
</ul>
<h5>Backend Technologies</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Apollo Server</strong>: A GraphQL server that works with any GraphQL schema</li>
  <li><strong>GraphQL Federation</strong>: A specification for building a unified graph from multiple subgraphs</li>
  <li><strong>Supergraph</strong>: The composed schema that combines all subgraphs into a single unified API</li>
  <li><strong>Apollo Router</strong>: A high performance graph router that implements the GraphQL Federation specification</li>
  <li><strong>Subgraphs</strong>: Independent GraphQL services that implement portions of the overall graph</li>
</ul>
<h5>Database and Data Access</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong>: A powerful, open source relational database system</li>
  <li><strong>Prisma</strong>: A next generation ORM that provides type safe database access</li>
  <li><strong>Repository Pattern</strong>: A design pattern that separates the data access logic from business logic</li>
</ul>

<h5>Development and Deployment</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>TypeScript</strong>: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript</li>
  <li><strong>Docker</strong>: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers</li>
  <li><strong>pnpm</strong>: A fast, disk space efficient package manager for JavaScript</li>
  <li><strong>Domain Driven Design</strong>: An approach to software development that focuses on the core domain and domain logic</li>
</ul>
<h5>Additional Technologies</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>JWT Authentication</strong>: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication</li>
  <li><strong>Stripe</strong>: Payment processing integration</li>
  <li><strong>Vitest</strong>: A testing framework for JavaScript</li>
  <li><strong>React Hook Form</strong>: A library for flexible and efficient form validation</li>
  <li><strong>Zod</strong>: A TypeScript first schema validation library</li>
</ul>

<h4>Architecture Overview</h4>
The application follows a modern architecture with clear separation of concerns:
