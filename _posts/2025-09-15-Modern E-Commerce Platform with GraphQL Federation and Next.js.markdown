In this post, I will outline an eâ€‘commerce platform using GraphQL Federation and Next.js. The goal was not just to spin up another demo shop, it was to explore how these technologies can work together to create a platform that is scalable, maintainable, and ready for real world complexity. Along the way, I will share the architectural decisions, trade offs, and lessons learned that you can apply to your own projects.
